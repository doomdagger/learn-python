## invoking the interpreter

    # most common
    python
    
    # with commands
    python -c command [arg] ...
    
    # execute module with its full name
    python -m module [arg] ...
    
    # run the script and enter interactive mode
    python -i script.py

### Argument Passing

The script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the `argv` variable in the `sys` module.

    import sys
    
    # The length of the list is at least one; 
    # when no script and no arguments are given, 
    # sys.argv[0] is an empty string.
    print(sys.argv)
    
When *-m* module is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to the full name of the located module.
